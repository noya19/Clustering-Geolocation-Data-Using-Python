# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Using-Python
  
The project uses clustering Techniques such as K-Means Clustering and Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise(DBSCAN)to find clusters based on Taxi Rank Locations, so that the most optimal places to set-up service centres could be estimated.  
The project visualizes the clustering Data  in a map using the **folium** library in python.
